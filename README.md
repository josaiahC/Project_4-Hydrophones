## Introduction <br>


Power spectral density is a measurement of how power from a signal or ambient noise is distributed amongst a range of frequencies. In part 1, Power Spectral Density versus Frequency graphs were constructed to examine the effects of the following weather conditions on underwater noise: windy and rainy, rainy but not windy, windy but not windy, and neither windy nor rainy. 

Spectrograms use color maps to visualize the most intense frequency components of a noise over time. In part 2, spectrograms were used to compare bandwidth, intensity, and duration for marine mammal vocalization, airgun noise, and seismic activity due to a volcanic eruption.

## <div align=center> Part 2: Airgun, Marine Mammals, Earthquake/Volcano Noise </div>

|Marine Mammal Vocalization|<img width=1900 alt="hello" src=spectrograms/mammals.png><br>Figure 9|
|Airgun Noise|<img alt="hello" src=spectrograms/airgun2.png><br>Figure 10|
|Axial Seamount Earthquake after volcanic eruption|<img alt="hello" src=spectrograms/earthquake.png><br>Figure 11|

In figure 9, the bandwidth of the captured marine mammal vocalization is 750-4500 Hertz; this is in agreement with the Wentz curve's 10- >100,000 Hz. Figure 10 shows a series of three airgun shots, all within 0-1200 Hz. Airgun noises are created by bubbles, and the Wenz curve states that bubble noises are in the frequency range of 100 to approximately 20,000 Hz, which encapsulates the frequency range of this signal. The seismic activity shown in figure 11 has a max frequency of ~130 Hz, which is close to the Wenz curve's range of 0-100 Hz
